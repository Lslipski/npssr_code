-Not all participants have the same number of files. A summary can be found in the count_subject_files notebook in this root folder.

-Only 25 subjects have all 24 expected files.

-We have data from 96 participants, but in the 'Serotonin transporter polymorphism alters citalopram effects on human pain responses to physical pain' study
they report only recruiting 56 participants.

-This study found interactions between genetics and citalopram. Should we include all participants and average the NPS effect over them?

-Each participant has 12 total conditions over 3 runs, but each run's conditions are the same. Should we average the conditions over the 3 runs?

-I could not get the prep_2_load_image_data_and_save script to run on this data because of missing data. I removed all participants who did not have
all 24 necessary files for now. To do this I used the bad_subject_list created in the count_subject_files notebook for this study to list the 
participants missing data. I then created the move_bad_files.sh script, which moved all files for those participants into a data/subj_missing_data 
folder.

-We currently have no behavioral data for this project --need to email Yina Ma for this.
