The following data issues were found in this dataset during QA and batch script processing:

The following files are named with the prefix 'MRI2' instead of 'MR2', so they were not being picked up by Tor's scripts.

2015_Zeidan_Mindfulness_ASL/data/mindfulness_meditation/MRI2_M00_4heat_concat_pre_post_heat_mr2_meansigma38_wm_reg.feat

2015_Zeidan_Mindfulness_ASL/data/mindfulness_meditation/MRI2_M02_4heat_concat_pre_post_heat_mr2_meansigma38_wm_reg.feat

Combined, these folders account for the discrepancies between my jupyter notebook expected participant counts and those found in the data objects that Tor's scripts use to calculate NPS values. I will change these filenames to 'MR2' and check with Tor if he is aware of this issue. Given that this seems like an error and not a delibeate subtle renaming, I will assume this is the case.
