This folder contains the data from Fadel Zeidan's 2015 paper: Mindfulness Meditation-Based Pain Relief Employs Different Neural
Mechanisms Than Placebo and Sham Mindfulness MeditationInduced Analgesia

Information about this study from either Fadel or Tor who provided me the data:
MR2 = post-intervention

resting ASL, 35 degrees

Pre = rest
Post = manipulation

neutral = 35 degree block two ASL images
heat = 49C series of stimuli two ASL images

4heat_concat_pre_post_heat_mr2_meansigma38_wm_reg
= 2 images pre, 2 post, these are post - pre contrasts
cope = [1 1 -1 -1] contrast or vice versa

pe1.nii = POST-intervention (***double check***)
pe2.nii = PRE-intervention  

C1 cope1 = post > pre
C2 cope2 = pre > post


From Fadel:
Brief overview. In the post intervention MRI sessions (I.e., mr2), we
stimulated subjects with 8 fMRI series. Four were labeled as “heat” which
included 10, 12-second plateaus of 49°C and four were labeled “neutral”
which included continual 35°C innocuous heat (our contrast series).
However, in this file, we only have four “heat” series. Two “heat”
pre-manipulation (rest) and two “heat” post-manipulation (I.e.,
meditating, sham meditating, placebo cream).
